This Python project is an interactive game inspired by the "Higher Lower" social media trend. It tests the user's knowledge of famous personalities, brands, and entities. The program pulls data from a predefined list, compares the follower counts, and tracks the user's score through consecutive correct answers.

Key Features:

Game Logic: Implements comparison operators to validate user input against data values.

Dynamic Scoring: Keeps a continuous tally of the user's score until they make an incorrect guess.

Data Handling: Uses a dictionary-based data structure to store and retrieve entity information.

UX Design: Clear console output and ASCII art for a better user experience.
